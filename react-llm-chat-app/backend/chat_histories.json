However, here's a breakdown of key figures and their contributions:\n\n*   **Democritus (around 460-370 BC):** He was a Greek philosopher who is often considered the first person to propose the concept of atoms. He theorized that matter was made up of indivisible particles, which he called \"atomos\" (meaning \"uncuttable\" or \"indivisible\"). However, this was purely philosophical speculation, and he had no experimental evidence.\n\n*   **John Dalton (1766-1844):** An English chemist and physicist, Dalton is credited with developing the first modern atomic theory in the early 1800s. His theory, based on experimental observations, included the following key points:\n\n    *   Elements are made of atoms.\n    *   Atoms of a given element are identical in mass and properties.\n    *   Compounds are combinations of two or more different kinds of atoms.\n    *   A chemical reaction is a rearrangement of atoms.\n\nDalton's theory was a major breakthrough because it provided a scientific basis for understanding chemical reactions and the composition of matter.\n\n*   **Later Scientists:** After Dalton, many scientists, including J.J. Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, Niels Bohr, and many others, contributed to our understanding of the structure of the atom (discovering that atoms are not indivisible and are composed of subatomic particles like electrons, protons, and neutrons).\n\nSo, while **Democritus** first came up with the idea of the atom, **John Dalton** is usually credited with developing the first *scientific* atomic theory. It was built upon over centuries with countless scientists adding more and more to the structure and behavior of the atom."
